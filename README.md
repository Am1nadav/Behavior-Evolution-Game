# Behavior-Evolution-Game

This game was created to study how behavior is formed under the influence of mutations in genes responsible for brain function.

The grass grows, you add one sheep and wait for the sheep to multiply. Then you add one lion and wait for the sheep and lions to breed, change generations and mutate. Within half an hour you can notice changes in the behavior of the sheep. Changes in the behavior of lions will occur only after a long time, when sheep, with the help of many mutations, learn to effectively evade lions, then mutational changes will begin in lions. The project is expected to run for many hours and even days to analyze the behavior of these animals. The project is currently under development. It is planned to add a function for saving the state of the world.

You can select an individual animal and get detailed information about it below. You can also see the work of the animalâ€™s brain and the genes responsible for behavior. It is possible to stop the world, follow it step by step and trace the brain function of the selected animal. For simplicity, the genes are made very primitively and the brain is also very primitive in these animals.
